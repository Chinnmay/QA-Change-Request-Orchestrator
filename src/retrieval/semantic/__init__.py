Semantic retrieval module.

This module provides a semantic retriever implementation that demonstrates
the extensibility of the retrieval system with advanced language understanding.
It's designed for future implementation with:
- LLM-based semantic embeddings
- Contextual similarity matching
- Domain-specific fine-tuned models
- Multi-language support
- Intent-based query processing
